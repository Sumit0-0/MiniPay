# 💸 Mini Pay

**Mini Pay** is a full-stack digital wallet and transaction management system. Built to simulate the real-world operations of a minimal payment service, it supports user registration, secure authentication, wallet balance tracking, and transaction history.

This project reflects secure backend practices, clean React frontend structure, and modern UI styling. It was developed as part of my learning and portfolio to demonstrate full-stack application building using modern technologies.
